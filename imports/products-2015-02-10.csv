1557,P,,"Humidors - Chalet",Humidor,"The Chalet humidor brings all of the benefits of a solid cedar humidor, but in a more modest finish and price. This compact but deep humidor will easily hold 50 Churchill sized cigars. Thanks to the divider included you can keep 2 boxes worth of cigars, separated very easily. Finished with a red, cherry-wood stain and fitted with a brass hinges. To ensure your cigars are kept at the optimum conditions, the Chalet comes complete with an analogue hydrometer and round humidification system. Exterior Dimensions Length -260mmDepth - 220mmHeight - 105mmWeight - 975g A humidor is essential for keeping cigars in optimal condition in climates which differ from that of the Caribbean and Central America. Almost all wooden Humidors are made from Spanish cedar or are lined with this magic wood. Unlike other woods, Cedar is porous, contains very little sap and resists warping when humid. These properties when combined with a humidification system allows a humidor to maintain a constant humidity with minimal effort. Before using your Humidor ensure it is correctly seasoned before use, following these simple steps will ensure your cigars are stored correctly. Seasoning the Humidor Your Humidor may have travelled 1000&rsquo;s of miles and the cedar could be dry. Cedar can both absorb and release moisture, if you place cigars in a dry humidor the cedar will absorb moisture from the cigar.  The easiest way to season a Humidor is take a shallow bowl (short enough to fit inside with the lid closed) and fill the bowl æ of the way with either Distilled Water (NEVER TAP or SPRING WATER) or special Humidor solution. Place the bowl in your humidor and close the lid for 24 hours, the moisture will slowly permeate into the cedar. After 24 hours open the humidor and if required top up the bowl to Ω full, leaving again for a further 24 hours.  The remaining water can then be used to fill up the humidification system, usually a round or rectangular device which is attached to the lid or base of the Humidor. If you can put the humidification system into the bowl, pop it in for 15 minutes and then allow the excess water to drain from the system. Give the device a quick wipe with a tissue or clean cloth and place into the humidor (often fitted with Velcro or Magnetic fastening). Calibrating Hydrometers Humidors which come fitted with a hydrometer give you an idea of the humidity inside your Humidor. Those that can be calibrated will come with instructions on doing so, for those that don&rsquo;t you can use the Boveda sachets we supply with every (untubed) cigar order. To do this place your hydrometer into a small sealed bag with the Bovida pack. After 24 hours check the reading on the dial or display, this should be close to the value on the Boveda bag. Please note that analogue devices can have a fault tolerance of +/-10% and Digital +/-5%. The reading shown will give you a benchmark to quickly asses the Relative Humidity. While Hydrometers may give a quick reading of the Humidity, the best way is the good old fashion &ldquo;feel&rdquo;. Humidor Placement and Maintenance The positioning of your Humidor can affect its performance, you should keep your Humidor in a position where a constant temperature can be maintained and away from Sunlight, Radiators/Heaters. Fluctuations in temperature can cause the humidity to go up and down, which over time will damage the cigars inside. The optimal temperature to keep a cigar at is between 16 & 18∞C (61 & 64∞F), any higher than 20∞C and the cigars can start to degrade and any tobacco bugs may hatch. At these optimal temperatures, you should aim for a 65-75% humidity. You can store cigars at a lower temperature and humidity, this is usually only done by aficionados who age cigars for prolonged periods before smoking. To maintain your cigars, it is best to rotate the cigars once a week and top up the humidification system once the humidity begins to drop. Do not allow the humidor to become dry, if this does happen you are best to re-season the humidor and start again. If you see any mould on the cigars in your humidor, you should remove all cigars and separate those with mould from those without. To ensure the mould spores are not left on the cedar it is advisable to give the interior cedar a light sanding with a fine grit sanding paper. You can then re-season the humidor and put the unaffected cigars back inside once it is ready. Sadly any mouldy cigar will have to be disposed of and should never be put back into the humidor. Keep an eye on the humidor and its contents, if mould comes back you will need to repeat the process.   With careful care and maintenance this should never happen to any of your cigars and your smokes will age with beauty.

1560,P,,"La Hoyo - Du Roi","Hoyo de Monterrey","The La Hoyo range was created in the 1940&rsquo;s for the Zurich based cigar importer A D¸rr Co. All ciagrs in the range come with slender ring gauges and have become out of vogue since the increase in popularity of more chunky cigars. The Du Roi combines the sweet and creamy nature of the standard Hoyos and signature strong woody flavours of the La Hoyo. As with all slender cigars, the Du Roi are best smoked slowly to get all the subtle flavours lying under the creamy woods. A true connoisseurs cigar. Hoyo de Monterrey have been one of the big names in the Cuban cigar world since the mid 1800&rsquo;s. Don JosÈ Gener emigrated from Spain to Cuba at the ripe age of 13. He began working on his uncles farm in the world renowned Vuelta Abajo, learning journey from seed to cigar. By his 32nd birthday, JosÈ opened his first factory in Havana and the &ldquo;Le EscepciÛn&rdquo; brand was born, becoming a success around the Spanish world. From the capital gained, JosÈ purchased the &ldquo;Hoyo de Monterrey&rdquo; planation in San Juan y Martinez region. The planation&rsquo;s name translates to Hole (Hoyo) de Monterrey and to this day is considered one of the finest and most fertile in all of Cuba. By 1865 JosÈ registered Hoyo De Monterrey as a cigar brand and began production using tobaccos form their own plantation. The sweet and aromatic qualities of the cigars produced became a hit with British smokers and before long, Hoyo De Monterrey became a big name with enthusiasts. By the time of JosÈ death in 1900, Hoyo de Monterrey was largest brand in Cuba, its factory employed over 350 rollers and produced 50 Million cigars a year. After JosÈ death the business was passed down to his Daughter, Lutgarda took over and sadly the business faulted without its main driving force. By 1931 the brand (Hoyo de Monterrey & Le EscepciÛn) had been sold to Fern·ndez Palicio y Ca, who already owned Punch and Belinda. By 1958 the collection of 4 brands made up 13% of Cuba&rsquo;s total cigar output.† Length - 5 5/8""Ring Gauge - 42Vitola - CoronaFlavour - MediumPackaging - Card Box Rolled in - CubaWrapper - CubanBinder - CubanFiller - Cuban",0.00,0.00,0.00,11.75,0.00,N,,50.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,Y,Y,"Ready to ship",Y,5,0,10/02/2015,10/02/2015,"Category Name: Cigars, Category Path: Cigars|Category Name: Cuban Cigars, Category Path: Cigar Styles/Country of Origin/Cuban Cigars|Category Name: Light to Medium Flavour, Category Path: Cigar Styles/Cigars by Strength/Light to Medium Flavour|Category Name: Cigars 4"" to 5"", Category Path: Cigar Styles/Cigars by Length/Cigars 4"" to 5""|Category Name: Cigars with a ring gauge of  41 to 50, Category Path: Cigar Styles/Cigars by Ring Gauge/Cigars with a ring gauge of  41 to 50|Category Name: Hoyo de Monterrey, Category Path: Cigars/Hoyo de Monterrey","Product Image File: La_hoyo_Du_Roi_5_Pack_HF_Image__22496.jpg, Product Image URL: http://www.gqtobaccos.com/product_images/i/644/La_hoyo_Du_Roi_5_Pack_HF_Image__22496.jpg|Product Image File: La_hoyo_Du_Roi_Single_HF_Image__63932.jpg, Product Image URL: http://www.gqtobaccos.com/product_images/m/359/La_hoyo_Du_Roi_Single_HF_Image__63932.jpg",,"Cheap Cuban Cigars, Discount Cuban Cigars, Discount La Hoyo Cigars, La Hoyo Cigars, Du Roi Cigars, Roi Cigars, Cheap La Hoyo Corona.
